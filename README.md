Dear github user,
I created this project track how much milk my daughter was consuming. 
The hope is to build a bunch of small sensors out of flex pcb and stick them on to the side of medela milk bottles.

I searched for cheap BLE enabled MCU's and I found that the PSoC4 was a good match as it also has capsense which will make sensing quite cheap and simple.

Ok bye,
Richard
